## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our simulation framework, Metaball-Imaging Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method, for fluid-particle system of complex morphologies. 

MI-DELBM is a robust simulation framework designed for fluid-particle systems featuring complex-shaped particles, where the Metaball function serves as the shape reconstructor. With its high-fidelity capability to capture particle morphologies from X-ray Computed Tomography, it offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of physical processes in diverse scientific and engineering contexts. This method is published in the paper titled "Metaball-Imaging Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method for fluid-particle system of complex morphologies with settling case study."

This repository contains the associated manuscript, code, data, and supplementary materials. We hope this work will be helpful to the research community and encourage further collaboration and exploration in the field.  If you find my work of interest, please feel free to cite, implement, or reuse it as needed. Your engagement and collaboration are highly encouraged.
